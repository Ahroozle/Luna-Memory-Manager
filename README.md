Luna Memory Manager

The Mnemosyne and Luna Memory Managers were small projects I did on the side in my spare time as a way to keep myself sharp on C/++ syntax and pointer operations.

Luna manages a pool of static memory and was less practice and more of a test I wanted to try out, as I'd never tried to manage a pool of static memory.

(Note: This project was created in Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 7. Results may vary depending on OS and Compiler.)
